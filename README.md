# Ecommerce-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes an eCommerce dataset of 30,000 customers to uncover actionable insights into purchasing behavior, engagement patterns, and long-term retention. Using R for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, and visualization, the project evaluates five core areas: churn prediction, customer segmentation, revenue drivers, referral source effectiveness, and loyalty program performance.

Key Business Questions Answered

What factors most strongly predict customer churn?

Which customer segments drive the highest lifetime value?

How do income and website engagement influence spending?

Which referral sources bring the most loyal customers?

What is the measurable impact of the loyalty program?

Impact & Findings

The analysis shows that income and time spent on the website are major predictors of spending levels. Loyalty program members demonstrate higher engagement and significantly lower churn rates. Additionally, friend referrals generate the most valuable long-term customers, while customers acquired through paid advertising show higher churn risk. The final churn model and segment profiles offer data-driven opportunities for more targeted retention strategies.

Recommendations

Expand the loyalty program with tiered incentives and personalized offers.

Prioritize referral-based acquisition over high-cost paid channels.

Implement targeted retention campaigns for at-risk segments identified by the churn model.

Optimize website experience to increase session duration and drive conversions.
