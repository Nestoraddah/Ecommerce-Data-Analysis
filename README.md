# Ecommerce-Data-Analysis
This project explores an eCommerce dataset of 30,000 customers to generate actionable insights into purchasing behavior, customer engagement, and retention. Using R for analysis and visualization, it focuses on five key areas: churn prediction, customer segmentation, revenue drivers, referral source performance, and loyalty program impact. The findings show that income and time spent on the website strongly influence spending levels, while loyalty program members demonstrate higher engagement and significantly lower churn. Additionally, referrals from friends yield the most loyal and valuable customers, whereas paid advertisements attract higher-churn segments. This project highlights how data analytics can empower eCommerce businesses to optimize marketing strategies, improve retention, and enhance overall customer lifetime value.
